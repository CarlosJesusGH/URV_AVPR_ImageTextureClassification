# Texture Classification
Classify a set of images according to textures.

---
# Description
The goal of this exercise is to correctly classify a set of images with textures into 6 classes. We have 24 images corresponding to four image samples of each kind of texture. The problem to solve is to find the features that classify each sample in the correct class: ideally, all samples of the same texture have to be in the same class.
